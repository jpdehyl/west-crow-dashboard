## Our Disposal Bins

We currently operate a 5-Ton truck with an 54″ Ampliroll Hookflift. We have 10, 20, and 30-yard disposal bins. All our bins have a max payload of 5000 Kgs. All our bins can carry aggregates (concrete, tile/mortar, asphalt, dirt etc) but they cannot be filled more than 6 cubic yards. If you’re uncertain about which bin size to choose for your project, contact us and simply provide us with the details of your project, and we’ll guide you in selecting the perfect bin size.

![yard bin](https://www.westcrow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/10yard-bin.png)

A **10-yard disposal bin** is ideal for small to medium-sized demolition projects. It can accommodate various items such as furniture, appliances, household clutter, construction debris (including drywall, lumber, flooring, and tiles), yard waste, concrete, asphalt, and clean fill. With regards to demolition, a 10-yard bin can handle **smaller demolition projects**.

![yard bin](https://www.westcrow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20yard-bin.png)

A **20-yard disposal bin** is well-suited for medium-sized demolition projects. It offers ample space to handle a range of items, including furniture, appliances, construction debris (including significant amounts of drywall, flooring, tiles, and demolition waste), roofing materials, etc… The larger capacity of a 20-yard bin makes it suitable for more **extensive demolition projects**.

![yard bin](https://www.westcrow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/30yard-bin.png)

A **30-yard disposal bin** is ideal for large-scale demolition projects. It can be used for a wide range of items, including furniture, appliances, extensive amounts of construction debris (including large quantities of drywall, flooring, tiles, and significant demolition waste), roofing materials, etc… The increased capacity of a 30-yard bin makes it well-suited for **major demolition projects**.

#### Hear What Our Clients Say About Our Services!

We have been working with the team at West Crow for over 4 years now. We regularly hear from our clients that Dave and his team are the most organized, punctual and professional sub-trade they experienced on their site. We would echo this as a company. They show up when they are scheduled, they complete the scope of work agreed upon and their communication is great. What else could you ask for from a sub-trade? We are more than happy to pass West Crow’s name along to other contractors and continue to use them for our demo and abatement needs.
